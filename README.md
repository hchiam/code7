The "Code 7 Project":  I practiced general programming skills by building ~7 simple programs over ~7 different weekends (when my other commitments allow it).

Find blog posts for each problem here:  [https://hchiam.blogspot.ca/2016/06/code-7-project-github-blog.html](https://hchiam.blogspot.ca/2016/06/code-7-project-github-blog.html)
